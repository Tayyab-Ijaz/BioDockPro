# BioDockPro

BioDockPro is an automated **bioinformatics pipeline** for molecular docking of ligands with protein targets.  
It supports **blind docking**, generates **2D and 3D visualizations** of docked complexes,  
and provides detailed tables of **binding energies** for downstream analysis.

## Features
- Automated ligandâ€“protein docking workflow
- Support for blind docking without prior binding site knowledge
- 2D and 3D complex visualization
- Binding energy extraction and tabulation
- Reproducible, script-based execution

## Planned Workflow
1. Input: protein structures (PDB) and ligand files (SDF/MOL2)
2. Perform docking using integrated tools
3. Generate visualization images and binding energy tables
4. Export results for publication or further analysis
